        <h1>Favorite place is VIZAG</h1>

        valour and is more popularly known as Vizag.

        <h1>Favorite Hero PSPK</h1>
        <p>Pawan Kalyan's name is often mentioned as PSPK, a short form of 'Powerstar Pawan Kalyan'. But not writing the same on any new poster can not be a coincidence, but an intended attempt from the actor-politician to distance himself from the filmy name tags.</p>
